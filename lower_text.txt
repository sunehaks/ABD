this is just a testing text file. the articles in english are the definite article the and the indefinite articles a and an. the definite article is used when the speaker believes that the listener knows the identity of the noun's referent (because it is obvious, because it is common knowledge, or because it was mentioned in the same sentence or an earlier sentence). the indefinite article is used when the speaker believes that the listener does not have to be told the identity of the referent. no article is used in some noun phrases.  english grammar requires that in most cases a noun phrase start with a determiner. the most common determiners are the articles the and a(n), which specify the presence or absence of definiteness of the noun. other possible determiners include words like this, my, each and many see english determiners. there are also cases where no determiner is required, as in the sentence john likes fast cars, where neither john nor fast cars includes a determiner.
